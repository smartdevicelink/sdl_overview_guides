# RPC Encryption

- [0207: RPC Message Protection](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0207-rpc-message-protection.md)

## Overview

The RPC Message Protection feature is designed to encrypt specific RPC messages transmitted between a mobile application and SDL.

## Determining When Encryption Is Needed

### SDL Application

An SDL app is informed about the encryption requirement by an `OnPermissionsChange` notification sent by SDL Core. The `OnPermissionsChange` notification has a `requireEncryption` boolean parameter, which indicates the encryption requirement on the app level.

```xml
<function name="OnPermissionsChange" functionID="OnPermissionsChangeID" messagetype="notification" since="2.0">
    <description>Provides update to app of which policy-table-enabled functions are available</description>
    <param name="permissionItem" type="PermissionItem" minsize="0" maxsize="500" array="true" mandatory="true">
        <description>Change in permissions for a given set of RPCs</description>
    </param>
    <param name="requireEncryption" type="Boolean" mandatory="false" since="6.0"/>
</function>
```

Each `PermissionItem` struct in the notification also contains a `requireEncryption` boolean parameter, which indicates the encryption requirement on the RPC level.

```xml
<struct name="PermissionItem" since="2.0">
    <param name="rpcName" type="String" maxlength="100" mandatory="true">
        <description>Name of the individual RPC in the policy table.</description>
    </param>
    <param name="hmiPermissions" type="HMIPermissions"  mandatory="true"/>
    <param name="parameterPermissions" type="ParameterPermissions"  mandatory="true"/>
    <param name="requireEncryption" type="Boolean" mandatory="false" since="6.0"/>
</struct>
```
Using the app level and RPC level encryption requirements, the app side will be able to determine whether the app needs encryption or not and which RPCs in particular will need encryption.

An RPC message will require encryption/protection if the app has `requireEncryption=true` in the `OnPermissionsChange` notification, and  the RPC has `requireEncryption=true` in the `PermissionItem`.

### SDL Core

SDL Core uses the `encryption_required` flags in the policy table to determine whether or not an RPC message requires encryption. 

The [`encryption_required`](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/guides/sdl-overview-guides/policies/policy-fields/#encryption_required) flag, in the `functional_groupings` section of the policy table, indicates whether or not **all** the RPCs within a functional group require encryption.

#### JSON Example

```json
"RemoteControl": {
    "encryption_required" : true,
    "rpcs": {
        "GetInteriorVehicleData": {
            "hmi_levels": ["BACKGROUND", "FULL", "LIMITED"]
        },
        "SetInteriorVehicleData": {
            "hmi_levels": ["BACKGROUND", "FULL", "LIMITED"]
        },
        ...
    }
}
```
Whereas the  [`encryption_required`](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/guides/sdl-overview-guides/policies/app-policies/#encryption_required) flag, in the `app_policies` section, indicates whether the app requires encryption or not.

#### JSON Example

```json
"app_policies": {
    "default": {
      "encryption_required": false,
      "keep_context": false,
      "steal_focus": false,
      "priority": "NONE",
      "default_hmi": "NONE",
      "groups": [
        "Base-4"
      ]
    },
    "appid_12345": {
      "encryption_required": true,
      "keep_context": false,
      "steal_focus": true,
      "priority": "NONE",
      "default_hmi": "NONE",
      "groups": [
        "Base-4", "RemoteControl"
      ]
    },
    ...
}
```
SDL Core informs an SDL application about the encryption requirement via an `OnPermissionsChange` notification.

!!! NOTE
- Multiple functional groups can include the same RPC, each group having an `encryption_required` flag. If an app has access to multiple functional groups containing the same RPC and **at least one** of the groups requires encryption, then the RPC shall require encryption.

- If `encryption_required=true` or `encryption_required` does not exist in the app's section in `app_policies`(i.e. on the app level), the flag in the applicable functional groups shall be checked.

- If `encryption_required=false` in the app's section in `app_policies`(i.e. in the app level), SDL Core and the SDL Application shall not enable RPC encryption, regardless of the value of `encryption_required` in the applicable functional groups.

- If `encryption_required=true` for a functional group, all the RPCs within that function group must be sent/received in an encryption enabled SDL service (The app has been authenticated via TLS handshake and RPC request and response messages are encrypted). 

- If `encryption_required=false` or `encryption_required` does not exist for a functional group, the RPC messages of that functional group shall not be encrypted and can be transmitted in both encryption enabled and disabled SDL services.
!!!

!!! NOTE
There are certain RPCs that can be sent in a non secure service despite the `encryption_required` flag being set to true

- RegisterAppInterface
- SystemRequest
- OnPermissionsChange
- OnSystemRequest
- PutFile
- OnHMIStatus
!!!

## Handling Unencrypted Messages

SDL Core sends this result code to an SDL app when it receives an un-encrypted RPC request message **that needs encryption**.

```xml
<enum name="Result" internal_scope="base" since="1.0">
...
    <element name="ENCRYPTION_NEEDED" since="6.0">
        <description>SDL receives an un-encrypted RPC request that needs protection. </description>
    </element>
</enum>
```
